                <p>"Debbie, Let me say a big thank you for choosing to work with me and asking all the right questions to get me to really focus on the outcome I wanted. You helped me create a space where I could really dig deep and find out what I perceived my limitations to be in realising my goal. I thoroughly appreciate the way you helped me to look at and identify what I could do to realise my goal and supported me in making my own plan of action. You also helped me to see the difference between how things would look and feel if I achieved or didn't achieve my goal. I went away feeling very much motivated and inspired. The goal I wish to accomplish has now been relinquished as being something I fear, but actually something tha tis possible, one step at a time. Many thanks.."</p>

In doing this she helped me reframe and address a rather complicated decision process with kindness and in a very skilled and more graceful way. I really loved her use of the imagery exercises which really made me sit in a new world of possibility, which I never considered before. Debbie is a beautiful warm soul and an equally skilled and professional coach and, as a coach and therapist myself, would wholeheartedly recommend her."</p>
